I am fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [College of Information Sciences & Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at **The Pennsylvania State University**, where I conduct research at the [Information Integrity Lab](https://www.rajtmajerlab.net/), under the guidance of Dr. Sarah Rajtmajer. My research focuses on exploring how Natural Language Processing methods, including Large Language Models, can be applied in specialized domains. I am also interested in social network analysis, misinformation, and computational social science.

I am always open to new collaborations, so feel free to email me if you want to chat. If you're seeking mentorship, please send a brief email introducing yourself and the topic you're interested in.
