I am a doctoral candidate in the [College of Information Sciences & Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at the **Pennsylvania State University**, where I conduct research at the [Information Integrity Lab](https://www.rajtmajerlab.net/). I am interested in exploring how Language Technology, including Large Language Models, can be utilized in specialized domains.

I am always open to new collaborations, so feel free to email me if you want to chat. If you're seeking mentorship, please send a brief email introducing yourself and the topic you're interested in.
